This course introduces the fundamental concepts and principles of operating systems. Topics covered include system performance, processes and threads, multiprogramming, scheduling, memory management, synchronization, deadlocks, file systems, input/output systems, security and protection, network and distributed OS.
<p>
Hands-on is carried out with assignments and projects using the <u><b>Linux</b></u> operating on the CS department <u><b>CS3 server</b></u>. Some discussion on the structure and design of operating systems such as LINUX are also covered.
<p>
The study of various aspects of operating systems to determine their dynamic behavior and to determine their performance, this is carried out with discrete-event object-oriented simulation using C++ and the Psim3 package installed on Linux. 
<p>
After successful completion of this course, a student should:
<ul>
    <li>Understand the conceptual workings and design fundamentals of operating systems</li>
    <li>Understand and be able to evaluate the features offered by various types of operating systems</li>
    <li>Understand and be able to evaluate performance issues of computer systems</li>
    <li>Be able to write short reports on the performance of various aspects of operating systems</li>

The Instructor expects your attendance at each and every class; however,
 actual attendance is up to the student. Grade performance is a 
demonstrated function of attendance, preparation and participation. You 
can get behind very easily by skipping classes, resulting in a poor 
understanding of the material, which will show up as a poor grade for 
the class. Any class sessions missed by the student are the student's 
responsibility to make up, not the instructor's. Late arrival that 
causes disruption, early departure that causes disruption, excessive 
conversation among students (a disruption in its own right), 
inappropriate use of electronic devices that cause disruptions,  and 
other actions that disrupt the classroom are unacceptable.

 The content will come from the text and other material presented in 
lecture. Note that material presented in class 
will supplement the assigned reading. Therefore, class attendance and 
good note taking are essential tactics for success. Students will not be
 allowed to bring class notebooks to the exams, nor will any other 
similar materials be permitted.

There will be no make-up examinations. It is the student's 
responsibility to arrange for an excused absence before the exam. A 
grade of zero will be assigned for all exams missed without an excused 
absence. If an emergency arises on the day of a midterm, and the 
instructor deems that the absence is excused, then the weight of the 
final exam may be increased to replace the midterm.</font>

improve its effectiveness. We value student feedback about the course, 
our teaching styles, and course materials, so as to improve our teaching

asked:
<ol>
    <li>Identify the aspects of the course that most contributed to your

<p>
<b>How to Activate your NetID:</b>
<br>
To activate your NetID go to http://netid.kennesaw.edu and click on

your identity and set your password. This password will only be for 
NETID enabled applications.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provisions of the 
Student Code of Conduct, as published in the Undergraduate and Graduate 
Catalogs.  Section II of the Student Code of Conduct addresses the 
University's policy on academic honesty, including provisions regarding 
plagiarism and cheating, unauthorized access to University materials, 
misrepresentation/falsification of University records or academic work, 
malicious removal, retention, or destruction of library materials, 
malicious/intentional misuse of computer facilities and/or services, and
 misuse of student identification cards.   Incidents of alleged academic
 misconduct will be handled through the established procedures of the 
University Judiciary Program, which includes either an "informal" 
resolution by a faculty member, resulting in a grade adjustment, or a 
formal hearing procedure, which may subject a student to the Code of 
Conduct's minimum one semester suspension requirement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Students are encouraged to study together and to work together on class 
assignments and lab exercises; however, the provisions of the STUDENT 
CONDUCT REGULATIONS, II. Academic Honesty, KSC Undergraduate Catalog 
will be strictly enforced in this class.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Frequently students will be provided with "take-home" exams or 
exercises.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure they fully 
understand to what extent they may collaborate or discuss content with 
other students.  No exam work may be performed with the assistance of 
others or outside material unless specifically instructed as 
permissible.  If an exam or assignment is designated "no outside 
assistance" this includes, but is not limited to, peers, books, 
publications, the Internet and the WWW.  If a student is instructed to 
provide citations for sources, proper use of citation support is 
expected.  Additional information can be found at the following 
locations.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
All IS students are encouraged to have a copy of the American 
Psychological Association (APA) Publication Manual, available in the KSU
 bookstore and elsewhere.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When any portion of another author's work is used, whether it be from a 
course textbook or outside work, including the World Wide Web, in whole,
 in part, or paraphrased, that work must be cited. Proper citation 
formats are provided on the reverse of this document. Failure to do so

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Academic Integrity Statement:</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
In any academic community, certain standards and ethical behavior are 
required to ensure the unhindered pursuit of knowledge and the free 
exchange of ideas. Academic honesty means that you respect the right of 
other individuals to express their views and opinions, and that you, as a
 student, not engage in plagiarism, cheating, illegal access, misuse or 
destruction of college property, or falsification of college records or 
academic work.

As a member of the Kennesaw State University academic community you are 
expected to adhere to these ethical standards.  You are expected to 
read, understand and follow the code of conduct as outlined in the KSU 
graduate and undergraduate catalogs.  You need to be aware that if you 
are found guilty of violating these standards you will be subject to 
certain penalties as outlined in the college judiciary procedures.  
These penalties include permanent expulsion from KSU.

Students are required to complete the Academic Integrity Quiz in 
Desire2Learn to acknowledge the receipt of this syllabus and to 
acknowledge that they agree to abide by the class policies and the 
academic integrity policies of the University.
