<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Introduction to database management systems, database processing, data modeling, database design, development, and implementation. Particular emphasis is placed on the relational approach to database management and processing, which focuses more on the logical nature of a database than its physical characteristics. Relational database programming assignments are drawn from the fields of business. Includes implementation of current DBMS tools and SQL.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
After successful completion of this course, a student should:
<ul>
    <li>Model data relevant to a database task, given a written description, reports and other information from a system user. Results should be resented as an Entity-Relationship Diagram</li>
    <li>Transform the entity-relationship model into a logical design, following the relational approach</li>
    <li>Normalize a given set of tables to third normal form</li>
    <li>Compose working SQL statements for simple and intermediate queries</li>
    <li>Build and modify a database schema using SQL</li>
    <li>Insert and modify data using SQL</li>
</ul>

The Instructor expects your attendance at each and every class; however, actual attendance is up to the student. Grade performance is a demonstrated function of attendance, preparation and participation. You can get behind very easily by skipping classes, resulting in a poor understanding of the material, which will show up as a poor grade for the class. Any class sessions missed by the student are the student's responsibility to make up, not the instructor's. Late arrival that causes disruption, early departure that causes disruption, excessive conversation among students (a disruption in its own right), inappropriate use of electronic devices that cause disruptions,  and other actions that disrupt the classroom are unacceptable.

There will be 2 midterm examinations and a cumulative final examination. The content will come from the text and other material presented in lecture sessions as well as the homework assignments. Note that material presented in class will supplement the assigned reading. Therefore, class attendance and good note taking are essential tactics for success. Students will not be allowed to bring class notebooks to the exams, nor will any other similar materials be permitted.
<br>
There will be no make-up examinations. It is the student's responsibility to arrange for an excused absence before the exam. A grade of zero will be assigned for all exams missed without an excused absence. If an emergency arises on the day of a midterm, and the instructor deems that the absence is excused, then the weight of the final exam may be increased to replace the midterm.</font>

Additional questions developed by the college or instructor(s) may be included as well. It is important that each student provide meaningful feedback to the instructor(s) so that changes can be made in the course to continually improve its effectiveness. We value student feedback about the course, our teaching styles, and course materials, so as to improve our teaching and your learning. At a minimum, the following two questions will be asked:
<ol>
    <li>Identify the aspects of the course that most contributed to your learning (include examples of specific materials, exercises and/or the faculty member's approach to teaching and mentoring), and</li>

KSU is moving towards a central authentication server that will allow one username and password to be used by all KSU users to access an increasing variety of applications (email, GeorgiaView etc.) This unified network identification is referred to as your "NetID". The new source for university-provided email and web space for students will be located at students.kennesaw.edu All students will have access to this system once they have established their NetID. This system will provide email service through a web based interface, FTP and SFTP.
<p>
<b>How to Activate your NetID:</b>
<br>
To activate your NetID go to http://netid.kennesaw.edu and click on "Sign up Now!" link. You will be asked to provide information to verify your identity and set your password. This password will only be for NETID enabled applications.
<p>
<b>How to Look Up a NetID:</b>
<br>
After you have activated your NetID, you can look up other users by logging into http://netid.kennesaw.edu and clicking on Directory Search.
<p>
<b>How to Send Email:</b>
<br>
For student email, your NetID in combination with the new email address would look like netid@students.kennesaw.edu.
<p>
<b>Web Address:</b>
<br>
For student web address, your NETID in combination with the new server address would look like http://students.kennesaw.edu/~netid.

Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provisions of the Student Code of Conduct, as published in the Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs.  Section II of the Student Code of Conduct addresses the University's policy on academic honesty, including provisions regarding plagiarism and cheating, unauthorized access to University materials, misrepresentation/falsification of University records or academic work, malicious removal, retention, or destruction of library materials, malicious/intentional misuse of computer facilities and/or services, and misuse of student identification cards.   Incidents of alleged academic misconduct will be handled through the established procedures of the University Judiciary Program, which includes either an "informal" resolution by a faculty member, resulting in a grade adjustment, or a formal hearing procedure, which may subject a student to the Code of Conduct's minimum one semester suspension requirement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Students are encouraged to study together and to work together on class assignments and lab exercises; however, the provisions of the STUDENT CONDUCT REGULATIONS, II. Academic Honesty, KSC Undergraduate Catalog will be strictly enforced in this class.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Frequently students will be provided with "take-home" exams or exercises.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure they fully understand to what extent they may collaborate or discuss content with other students.  No exam work may be performed with the assistance of others or outside material unless specifically instructed as permissible.  If an exam or assignment is designated "no outside assistance" this includes, but is not limited to, peers, books, publications, the Internet and the WWW.  If a student is instructed to provide citations for sources, proper use of citation support is expected.  Additional information can be found at the following locations.

<font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Academic Integrity Statement:</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
In any academic community, certain standards and ethical behavior are required to ensure the unhindered pursuit of knowledge and the free exchange of ideas. Academic honesty means that you respect the right of other individuals to express their views and opinions, and that you, as a student, not engage in plagiarism, cheating, illegal access, misuse or destruction of college property, or falsification of college records or academic work.

As a member of the Kennesaw State University academic community you are expected to adhere to these ethical standards.  You are expected to read, understand and follow the code of conduct as outlined in the KSU graduate and undergraduate catalogs.  You need to be aware that if you are found guilty of violating these standards you will be subject to certain penalties as outlined in the college judiciary procedures.  These penalties include permanent expulsion from KSU.

Students are required to complete the Academic Integrity Quiz in Desire2Learn to acknowledge the receipt of this syllabus and to acknowledge that they agree to abide by the class policies and the academic integrity policies of the University.
