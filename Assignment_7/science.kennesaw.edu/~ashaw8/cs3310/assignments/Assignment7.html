    <h1>Assignment #7: Database Implementation</h1>

<p>
In this Assignment you will learn the basics of how to create tables for your own Custom Shopping Cart web application using Visual Studio 2012 and the MVC framework (Model-View-Controller).  In the MVC framework, your tables will serve as the Model, the Views will be created using templates you will be given, and C# code serves as the Controller.  Most of the Controller code will be provided for you</p>

<p>Create the <u>ShoppingCart</u> project as an ASP.NET MVC 2 Web Application, and answer "No, do not create a unit test project," when the "Would you like to create a unit test project for this application" question is asked.
<p>
Once you have done that, you will see the Server Explorer on the right side of your IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  The first thing you will need to is replace the current Site.css file in your Content folder of the Server Explorer with the following: <a href="Site.css" target="_blank">Site.css</a>.  Do this by downloading this file and then adding it to your Contents folder by right-clicking on the Contents folder and choosing "Add Existing Item" and then finding and selecting the file you just downloaded.  Choose the "Yes" option when you are asked if you want to replace the existing file.
<p>
Once you have done that, you will need to replace another file, this time inside you "Shared" folder that is inside your Views folder.  Use the same process described in the last paragraph to replace the existing Site.Master file with the following one: <a href="Site.Master" target="_blank">Site.Master</a>. And after that add the <a href="ShoppingCart1.Master" target="_blank">ShoppingCart1.Master</a> file to the same "Shared" folder.
<p>
Once you have done that, you will need to add all of the following three images to your Content folder.  Do this again by downloading the files and then righ-clicking on the Contents folder and choosing "Add Existing Item" and then finding and selecting the files you just downloaded:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="newBackground.jpg" target="_blank">newBackground.jpg</a></li>
<li><a href="aboutus.jpg" target="_blank">aboutus.jpg</a></li>
<li><a href="logo.jpg" target="_blank">logo.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The next step to take is to create your database. To do that, right-click on the "App_Data" folder in the Solution Explorer and select Add and then New Item, and then click on Data and SQL Server Database, and place <u>ShoppingCartDB</u> in the Name field:
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart1.png width=600>
<p>
When it is created, you should see your Database in the ServerExplorer.  When it is there, you will create two tables in your database, the <u>Customers</u> table and the <u>Products</u> table.
<hr>
<center>The Customers Table</center>
<p>To create the <u>Customers</u> table open up the ShoppingCardDB.mdf item by clicking on the arrow next to it, and then right-click on the Tables folder and select "Add New Table".  Next, you will create the following fields in this  table, and notice that the ID field is a Primary Key, and it is an "Identity Specification" field.  Also not which fields "Allow Nulls" and which do not: 
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart2.png>
<p>
Now save your Table and give it the name <u>Customers</u>.  
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart2B.png>
<p>
Next, you will create a new Model for your table by right-clicking  on the Models folder in the Solution Explorer and select Add and then New Item. Select the Data category and select the ADO.NET Entity Data Model template. Then give your data model the name <u>CustomersModel.edmx</u>:
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart3.png width=600>
<p>
After you click the Add button, the Entity Data Model Wizard appears, and under the line "What should the model contain?" select the Generate from database option.
<p>
<img src=ChooseModel.png>
<p>
Then in the next screen, in the drop-down box under the line "Which data connection should your application use to connnect to the database?", choose ShoppingCartDB.mdf, and note that the "entity connection settings" shown at the bottom should say "ShoppingCartDBEntities".
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart4.png width=600>
<p>
After you click the Next button, you will go to the "Choose Your Database Objects" screen, where you must expand the Tables node, and select the Customers table:
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart5.png width=600>
<p>
When you click on the finish button, you will have a CustomersModel.edmx file in your Models folder, and you will see the Customer record as follows.
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart6.png>
<p>
Now you are finished with creating the Customers table.
<hr>
<center>The Products Table</center>
<p>To create the <u>Products</u> table go into the Server Explorer and open up the Tables folder inside of the ShoppingCartDB database.  To add the Products table to the database, right click on the Tables folder and select "Add New Table".  Next, you will create the following fields in this table, and notice that the ProductID field is a Primary Key, and it is an "Identity Specification" field.  And also note that only the ProductName field and the ImageFile fields are marked as "Allow Nulls": 
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart7.png>
<p>
Now save your Table and give it the name <u>Products</u>.  
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart8.png>
<p>
Next, you will create a new Model for your table by right-clicking  on the Models folder in the Solution Explorer and select Add and then New Item. Select the Data category and select the ADO.NET Entity Data Model template. Then give your data model the name <u>ProductsModel.edmx</u>:
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart9.png width=600>
<p>
After you click the Add button, the Entity Data Model Wizard appears, and under the line "What should the model contain?" select the Generate from database option.
<p>
<img src=ChooseModel.png>
<p>
Then in the next screen, in the drop-down box under the line "Which data connection should your application use to connnect to the database?", choose ShoppingCartDB.mdf, and note that the "entity connection settings" shown at the bottom should say "ShoppingCartDBEntities1".  If you don't see a "1", take special note of the number you do see because you will need to use that number later.
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart10.png width=600>
<p>
After you click the Next button, you will go to the "Choose Your Database Objects" screen, where you must expand the Tables node, and select the Products table only, and not the other table:
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart11.png width=600>
<p>
When you click on the finish button, you will have a ProductsModel.edmx file in your Models folder, and you will see the WebsiteProduct record as follows.
<p>
<img src=ShoppingCart12.png>
<p>
Now you are finished with creating the Products table.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The next thing you should do is go to the "Build" menu and choose "Build Solution".
<p>
Next, you should add product data to your Products table.  To do this just right-click on the table name in the Server Explorer, and choose "Show Table Data".  And then you can enter in the product data line by line.  This data consist of the Product Type (which is also the Product View name), the Product Name, the name of the Image File for the product, the Unit Price for the product, the Max Amount of items a user can purchase of the product (put -1 if there is no maximum), and the initial default number of product items purchases (this should usually be zero).
<p>
Note that you must add your images to the Contents folder separately, and if you don't add an image or an image label for a product, a [No Image] label will be shown.  The following is an example of table data that will product the product view shown below:

Each of your product views would show the user a page consisting of the product images, their prices, and a field that determines how many items of that product the user wants to purchase.
<p>
Let's assume that our Fun Cake Store were to have 5 categories of cakes: 1) Single Layer Cakes, 2) Double Layer Cakes, 3) Triple Layer Cakes, 4) Birthday Cakes, and 5) Specialty cakes.  Then the tabs for the product views for those 5 categories along with a "Check-Out" tab, an "About" tab, and an "Admin" tab might look like the following:
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<p>
Below is a list of images for those 5 product views and below that are examples of what those views might look like with the right table information:

Once you have added the images you are ready to add the Controller code you will need to manage the data in the tables and in the Views.  That code goes in the HomeController.cs file that is in the Controllers folder in your Solution Explorer.  At the top of that file are the libraries that you need include that are used by your code.  You must add two more libraries to that group of libraries as follows:
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<pre>
using ShoppingCart.Models;
using System.Net.Mail;
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
A little lower down, you must add a few fields to your code that will determine what the Heading and Tab Views are on your site.  Add the following fields declarations right above the Index() method (which is to say right above the "public ActionResult Index()" line):
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<pre><font size=3>
        // Text for Site Heading
        string siteHeading = "The Fun Cake Store";

        // Text for View Heading for each Tab
        string[] tabHeadings = { "Home", "Single Layer Cake", "Double Layer Cake", "About" };

        // View method name for each Tab
        string[] tabViews = { "Index", "Tab1Orders", "Tab2Orders", "About" };

        // View label displayed on each Tab
        string[] tabLabels = { "Home", "1-Layer", "2-Layer", "About" };
</font></pre>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Next is the rest of the Controller code that you need to add.  This code goes right after the About method that is just a little below where you just made your change.  When you copy and paste in this code, it will only implement 2 of the 5 views we have images for.  The following is the code you need to add:
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<pre><font size=3>

        // Action Method for First Product View
        public ActionResult Tab1Orders()
        {
            Session["ProductType"] = tabViews[1];
            ViewData["Message"] = Session["Message"] = tabHeadings[1] + " Orders:";
            return View(loadViewTableData(Session["ProductType"].ToString(),1));
        }

        // Action Method for First Product View
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult Tab1Orders(string button, FormCollection collection)
        {
            string pType = Session["ProductType"].ToString();
            int amount = Int32.Parse(Session[pType + "ItemAmount"].ToString());
            LoadSubmission(pType, amount, collection);

            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= amount; i++)
            {
                int value;
                if (!Int32.TryParse(collection[i - 1], out value) || value &lt; 0)
                {
                    ViewData.ModelState.AddModelError("", "Error: You put an invalid amount in Item #" + i);
                    ViewData["Message"] = Session["Message"];
                    return View(pType, loadViewTableData(pType,1));
                }
            }

            ViewData["Message"] = Session["Message"] = tabHeadings[2] + " Orders:";
            return View(loadViewTableData(Session["ProductType"].ToString(),2));
        }

        [HttpPost]

With the above code added to your program, you are almost ready to run your website.  All you need to do now is create the View page files for the two product views that are implemented in this code.  To do that for the first one, right-click on the Tab1Orders method and select "Add View", and then where it says "Select Master Page", click on the button and choose ShoppingCart1.Master and then click on Add.  When you have done this you will be taken to the newly created view page.  Click on the "Source" option at the bottom, and you will see the following code:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;h2&gt;Tab1Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Replace this code with the following code:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= ViewData["Message"]%&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You are now finished with the Tab1Orders view, so
go back into your HomeController code, and follow the same steps to create the Tab2Orders view by right-clicking on the Tab2Orders method and selecting "Add View", and then doing all of the same steps you did for Tab2Orders.  When you are finished, you can run your website and you should see the product details from your table displayed in the two product views.
<p>

<hr>

<p>In order to change what products are shown you will need to add your product images to the Contents folder.  You will do that by right-clicking on the Contents folder in the Solution Explorer and choosing "Add" and then "Existing Item..." and then browse for your image files and select them and click on the "Add" button.

<p>Once your images are in the Contents folder all you need to do is add them to the Products table.  To do this, follow these steps:

<p>
<ol><li> Open up the "ShoppingCartDB.mdf" database in the Server Explorer.  Then open the Tables folder and right-click on Products table and select "Show Table Data".  After that you should see the actual data in the Products table and you should be able to change the image files listed there so that they become the names of the image files you added to the Content folder.  When you have done that you should see your images when you run the program instead of the cake images.

<p><li>For those first two views you should be able to add as many product images as you like, along with their product names and product prices, by just adding new rows to the table with the right view names in the Product Type column and the other product details in their appropriate columns.  If you put a positive number in the MaxAmout column, the website will display a dropdown allowing the user to choose no more than that many items of that product.  But if you put -1 in the MaxAmount, then the view will dispay a simple input box for the number of products to buy, and the user can type in as high a value as they like.

<p><li>You should change the Heading shown for your product from "The Fun Cake Store" to whatever heading you want for the name of your online store.  Do this by changing the <b>siteHeading</b> value in the HomeController.cs code near the top to the correct text that you want.

<p><li>You should also change the tabs of the two product views to whatever is appropriate for the products and the images you are using.  You put your new labels in the <b>tabLabels</b> array, changing "1-Layer" and "2-Layer" to whatever labels are the right ones for your product.  You will also find the <b>tabLabels</b> array near the top in the HomeController.cs code.

<p><li>Next, change the subheadings on those two product views to whatever is appropriate for the images you are using.  You put your new subheading in the <b>tabHeadings</b> array, changing "Single Layer Cake" and "Double Layer Cake" to whatever subheadings are the right ones for your product.  You will also find the <b>tabHeadings</b> array near the top in the HomeController.cs code.


<p><li>Next, you should add more labels for the different product categories that you will be selling.  Each tab represents a new category.  Whatever new tab categories you add, you will need new images, labels and subheadings that go with them.  Add the images to the Contents folder and add new <b>tabLabels</b> and <b>tabHeadings</b> after the two you have already modified.  Also add new strings to the <b>tabViews</b> array that represent the new View names for the new tabs.  To keep it simple you can make the new view names "Tab3Orders" and "Tab4Orders" and so on, for as many as you will be adding (although you can use any names you like for the views as long as you remember to use those same names inside the Products table in the ProductType column to assign those views the correct product information).

<p><b>Note:</b> Your <b>tabViews</b> array, <b>tabLabels</b> array, and your <b>tabHeadings</b> array <b>should always have the same amount of items</b> in them because they have corresponding information.

<p><li>And lastly, when you have finished adding the data to Products table, you have to create two controller methods with the name of each view you are adding.  Each view requires two methods with the same name, just as you can see that there are two methods with the name "Tab1Orders" and two methods with the name "Tab2Orders".  When you add the two methods you will just duplicate the two "Tab2Orders" methods and then just add one to the index in the <b>tabViews</b> and <b>tabHeadings</b> arrays that are in those methods, and add 1 to the number sent to loadViewTableData() in the return of that method.  So for instance, after making your changes for "Tab3Orders" view you added, you will end up with two new Tab3Orders methods like so:
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<pre><font size=3>
        // Action Method for Third Product View
        public ActionResult Tab3Orders()
        {
            Session["ProductType"] = tabViews[3];
            ViewData["Message"] = Session["Message"] = tabHeadings[3] + " Orders:";
            return View(loadViewTableData(Session["ProductType"].ToString(),3));
        }

        // Action Method for Third Product View
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult Tab3Orders(string button, FormCollection collection)
        {
            string pType = Session["ProductType"].ToString();
            int amount = Int32.Parse(Session[pType + "ItemAmount"].ToString());
            LoadSubmission(pType, amount, collection);

            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= amount; i++)
            {
                int value;
                if (!Int32.TryParse(collection[i - 1], out value) || value < 0)
                {
                    ViewData.ModelState.AddModelError("", "Error: You put an invalid amount in Item #" + i);
                    ViewData["Message"] = Session["Message"];
                    return View(pType, loadViewTableData(pType,3));
                }
            }

            if (button == "Save And Go To Checkout")
            {
                return RedirectToAction("CheckOut");
            }
            else
            {
                return RedirectToAction(tabViews[4]);  // This is the View for the next product page
            }
        }
</font></pre>

<p>
<li>With the above code added to your program, you are almost ready to run your new views on your website.  All you need to do now is create the View page file for the new views that you are implementing in this code.  To do that for each new view name, right-click on the method name (like Tab3Orders) and select "Add View", and then where it says "Select Master Page", click on the button and choose ShoppingCart1.Master and then click on Add.  When you have done this you will be taken to the newly created view page.  Click on the "Source" option at the bottom, and you will see the following code:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;h2&gt;Tab3Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Or it may say Tab4Orders, or whatever your new view name is called.  Whatever is there, replace this code with the following code:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= ViewData["Message"]%&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Do these steps only once for each new view.  So even though you have two methods for the Tab3Orders view, you will only go through this process once for the Tab3Orders view, and once for the Tab4Orders view if you have a Tab4Orders view, and so on.
</ol>
<hr>
<p>
When you are finished making these changes, you should be all set.  Now when you run your website you should see all your product views, and those views should be using the details from your Products table.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>Zip your ShoppingCart project folder and then turn in the following file:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <code>ShoppingCart.zip</code> </li>
    </ul>

<p>You only need to turn in one ZIP file per team with all of your product views in it, but I encourage each member of your team to go through the steps of getting this code working on their own computer in order to get a little familiar with Visual Studio.

<p>Turn in your file by uploading it as an attachment to Assignment 07 in the Homework Assignments section
