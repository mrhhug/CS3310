After you download MS SQL Server 2008 R2 there are multiple steps involved necessary to install it.  Run the setup.exe file or the autorun.inf and then take the steps below in the screens that follow:
<p>
<ol>
<li>On this first screen, click on the "Installation" option under the word "Planning":</li>
<p>

<p>
<li>In the following screen, click on the "New installation or add features to an existing installation" option:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install01.png width=700>
<p>
<li>The System Configuration Checker runs a discovery operation on your computer. You can view the details on the screen by clicking Show Details as shown, although you don't have to see the details. After this click on <b>OK</b> to move to the next step.  However, if there are any problems identified in this step, you  need to address them before moving to the next step:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install02.png width=700>
<p>
<li>The Product Key for your installation should be entered for you on the next screen:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install03.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Accept the License Terms on the next screen:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install04.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Click on the <b>Install</b> button on the next screen:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install05.png width=700>
<p>
<li>A pop-up warning will tell you that at the end of the installation a reboot will be required, but the reboot will not happen right now.  It will not happen until after all of the installation steps in this tutorial have been completed.</li>
<p>
<img src=Install06.png width=700>
<p>
<li>The System Configuration Checker runs a discovery operation on your computer. You can view the details on the screen by clicking Show Details as shown, and that will probably show you a warning about your Firewall setting.  You can ignore that warning and click on <b>Next</b> to move to the next step.  However, if there are any other problems identified in this step, you  need to address them before moving to the next step:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install07.png width=700>
<p>
<li>In the next screen, select "SQL Server Feature Installation" and then click <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install08.png width=700>
<p>
<li>In the next screen, select "Select All" and then click <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install09.png width=700>
<p>
<li>The System Configuration Checker runs another discovery operation on your computer. You can view the details on the screen by clicking Show Details as shown, although you don't have to see the details. After this click on <b>Next</b> to move to the next step.  However, if there are any problems identified in this step, you need to address them before moving to the next step:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install10.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Click on the <b>Default Instance</b> option on the next screen and then click on <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install11.png width=700>
<p>
<li>On the next screen click on <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install12.png width=700>
<p>
<li>On the next screen, the Server Configuration step, you are to choose what account the SQL Server services will use to do things in the background.  I have found that it is best if these services are given network access.  To give this access, first click on the "Use the same account for all SQL Server services" button.</li>
<p>
<img src=Install13a.png width=700>
<p>
Then in the pop-up that shows up next asking for an Account name click on the "Browse" button:
<p>
<img src=image_thumb_14.png>
<p>
Then in the "Select User or Group" pop-up that shows up next, type in the word "NETWORK SERVICE" as shown below and then click on <b>OK</b>:
<p>
<img src=Install13b.png width=700>
<p>
Then you will go back to the "Use the same account for all SQL Server 2008 R2 services" pop-up, and it should show in the Account Name box "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE", with nothing in the Password box.  That is how it should be, so don't put in a password, and just click on the <b>OK</b> button, and then on the <b>Next</b> button after that:
<p>
<img src=Install13c.png width=700>
<p>
<li>On the next screen, the Database Engine Configuration step, you are to choose who can configure the DBMS.  You want to add yourself and the Administrators user group here.  To do that, first click ont the <b>Add Current User</b> button: </li>
<p>
<img src=Install14a.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Your username information should show up (in the example shown, the username is User_2, which probably is NOT what you see because that is probably NOT your username).  Next, you want to add the Administrators user group, and to do that, first click on the  <b>Add</b> button, and then in the pop-up type in "Administrators" and then click on the <b>Check Names</b> button.  After doing this, in front of the "Administrators" name you typed in should be added the name of your computer (which is USER-LAPTOP in the example shown here, but is probably something different for you).  Then click on the <b>OK</b> button after that:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install14b.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Now you should see your Username information and "BUILTIN\Administrators (Administrators)" added as shown below in the SQL Server administrators box.  Then click <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install14c.png width=700>
<p>
<li>On the next screen, the Analysis Services Configuration step, follow the exact same instructions that you did in the last step to add your account and the Administrators user group here as well.  When you are done you should see your Username information and "BUILTIN\Administrators (Administrators)" added as shown below in the SQL Server administrators box.  Then click <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install15.png width=700>
<p>
<li>On the next screen, select the <b>Install the native mode default configuration</b> option and then click on <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install16.png width=700>
<p>
<li>You don't have to select anything on the next screen.  Just click on <b>Next</b>:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install17.png width=700>
<p>
<li>The System Configuration Checker will run one more set of rules to validate your computer configuration with the SQL Server features that you have specified. You can view the details on the screen by clicking Show Details as shown, although you don't have to see the details. After this click on <b>Next</b> to move to the next step.  However, if there are any problems identified in this step, you  need to address them before moving to the next step:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install18.png width=700>
<p>
<li>Now you are almost done with all of the configuration information.  The system is ready to be installed.  Click on the <b>Install</b> button and be prepared to wait a while as MS SQL Server 2008 R2 is installed on your computer:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install19.png width=700>
<p>
<li>You have now successfully installed everything and there will need to be a restart.  Click  <b>OK</b> to this notification:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install20a.png width=700>
<p>
<li>More of the same information is given.  Click  <b>OK</b> to this notification and then click on the <b>Close</b> button and restart your computer:</li>
<p>
<img src=Install20b.png width=700>
<p>
<li>After the restart you should be all set with <b>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2</b> installed on your computer.  When you open the program group, you will run <b>SQL Server Management Studio</b> to complete your assignments.</li>
