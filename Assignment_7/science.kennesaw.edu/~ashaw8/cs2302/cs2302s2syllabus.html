<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
An extension of CS 2301 that covers more advanced object-oriented programming concepts.<br>&nbsp;<br>
After successful completion of this course, a student should:
<ul>
    <li>Understand the basic principles of object-oriented programming, including inheritance and polymorphism</li>
    <li>Understand both the "program driven" and "event-driven" 
approaches to user interaction, including the relationship between 
event-driven programs and Graphical User Interfaces</li>
    <li>Understand the fundamentals of exception handling</li>
    <li>Be able to design and implement algorithms utilizing the principles of object-oriented programming to solve elementary problems</li>
    <li>Be able to follow specified style guidelines in writing 
programs, and understand how the guidelines enhance readability and 
promote correctness in programs</li>
    <li>Be able to edit, compile, debug and run moderate sized programs in a specific programming language</li>
</ul>
SPECIAL NOTICE: This course will make use of a laboratory and assign relevant
  lab work and exercises. In order to
  participate in any of the course labs or other assignments (required to earn a
  passing grade in this course), each student is advised to locate and read KSU's
  Information Technology Computer Usage Polices (which can be found at
  <a href="http://www.kennesaw.edu/its/compuse.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.kennesaw.edu/its/compuse.shtml</a>).

<b><i><u>Required:</u></i></b><br>
There is a Custom Textbook required for this course:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Pearson Custom Computer Science Textbook for CS 2301/2302/3401. (Fall 2012, Pearson Prentice Hall)</b>
<p>
When you buy this book at the campus bookstore, it will include a 
Redemption Code that allows you to download and use an electronic 
version of the book -or- you can just buy the Redemption Code and only 
use the electronic version (See <a href="http://www.pearsoncustom.com/ga/ksu_java/" target="_blank">http://www.pearsoncustom.com/ga/ksu_java/</a>).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Supplemental resources: <i>Software</i></b><br>
This course revolves around writing, compiling, and running programs. The needed software is available
for use in the KSU computer laboratories, but most students find it to be much more convenient to be
able to do the necessary work on their own computers. Instructions for installing are on the class website
and can be found at:

The Instructor expects your attendance at each and every class; however,
 actual attendance is up to the student. Grade performance is a 
demonstrated function of attendance, preparation and participation. You 
can get behind very easily by skipping classes, resulting in a poor 
understanding of the material, which will show up as a poor grade for 
the class. Any class sessions missed by the student are the student's 
responsibility to make up, not the instructor's. Late arrival that 
causes disruption, early departure that causes disruption, excessive 
conversation among students (a disruption in its own right), 
inappropriate use of electronic devices that cause disruptions,  and 
other actions that disrupt the classroom are unacceptable.

There will be 3 midterm examinations and a cumulative final examination.
 The content will come from the text and other material presented in 
lecture sessions as well as labs. Note that material presented in class 
will supplement the assigned reading. Therefore, class attendance and 
good note taking are essential tactics for success. Students will not be
 allowed to bring class notebooks to the exams, nor will any other 
similar materials be permitted.
<br>
There will be no make-up examinations. It is the student's 
responsibility to arrange for an excused absence before the exam. A 
grade of zero will be assigned for all exams missed without an excused 
absence. If an emergency arises on the day of a midterm, and the 
instructor deems that the absence is excused, then the weight of the 
final exam may be increased to replace the midterm.</font>

developed by the college or instructor(s) may be included as well. It is
 important that each student provide meaningful feedback to the

improve its effectiveness. We value student feedback about the course, 
our teaching styles, and course materials, so as to improve our teaching

asked:
<ol>
    <li>Identify the aspects of the course that most contributed to your

system once they have established their NetID. This system will provide 
email service through a web based interface, FTP and SFTP.
<p>
<b>How to Activate your NetID:</b>
<br>
To activate your NetID go to http://netid.kennesaw.edu and click on

your identity and set your password. This password will only be for 
NETID enabled applications.

After you have activated your NetID, you can look up other users by 
logging into http://netid.kennesaw.edu and clicking on Directory Search.

For student email, your NetID in combination with the new email address would look like netid@students.kennesaw.edu.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provisions of the 
Student Code of Conduct, as published in the Undergraduate and Graduate 
Catalogs.  Section II of the Student Code of Conduct addresses the 
University's policy on academic honesty, including provisions regarding 
plagiarism and cheating, unauthorized access to University materials, 
misrepresentation/falsification of University records or academic work, 
malicious removal, retention, or destruction of library materials, 
malicious/intentional misuse of computer facilities and/or services, and
 misuse of student identification cards.   Incidents of alleged academic
 misconduct will be handled through the established procedures of the 
University Judiciary Program, which includes either an "informal" 
resolution by a faculty member, resulting in a grade adjustment, or a 
formal hearing procedure, which may subject a student to the Code of 
Conduct's minimum one semester suspension requirement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Students are encouraged to study together and to work together on class 
assignments and lab exercises; however, the provisions of the STUDENT 
CONDUCT REGULATIONS, II. Academic Honesty, KSC Undergraduate Catalog 
will be strictly enforced in this class.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Frequently students will be provided with "take-home" exams or 
exercises.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure they fully 
understand to what extent they may collaborate or discuss content with 
other students.  No exam work may be performed with the assistance of 
others or outside material unless specifically instructed as 
permissible.  If an exam or assignment is designated "no outside 
assistance" this includes, but is not limited to, peers, books, 
publications, the Internet and the WWW.  If a student is instructed to 
provide citations for sources, proper use of citation support is 
expected.  Additional information can be found at the following 
locations.

All IS students are encouraged to have a copy of the American 
Psychological Association (APA) Publication Manual, available in the KSU
 bookstore and elsewhere.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When any portion of another author's work is used, whether it be from a 
course textbook or outside work, including the World Wide Web, in whole,
 in part, or paraphrased, that work must be cited. Proper citation

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Academic Integrity Statement:</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
In any academic community, certain standards and ethical behavior are 
required to ensure the unhindered pursuit of knowledge and the free 
exchange of ideas. Academic honesty means that you respect the right of 
other individuals to express their views and opinions, and that you, as a
 student, not engage in plagiarism, cheating, illegal access, misuse or 
destruction of college property, or falsification of college records or 
academic work.

As a member of the Kennesaw State University academic community you are 
expected to adhere to these ethical standards.  You are expected to 
read, understand and follow the code of conduct as outlined in the KSU 
graduate and undergraduate catalogs.  You need to be aware that if you 
are found guilty of violating these standards you will be subject to 
certain penalties as outlined in the college judiciary procedures.  
These penalties include permanent expulsion from KSU.

Students are required to complete the Academic Integrity Quiz in 
Desire2Learn to acknowledge the receipt of this syllabus and to 
acknowledge that they agree to abide by the class policies and the 
academic integrity policies of the University.
