<b><u>On Windows:</u></b>
<ol>
<li>Install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK):</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Go to the following site: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html" target="_blank">
Java SE Development Kit 7 Downloads</a>.</li>
<li>Select your platform, then click on continue and follow the instructions to download and install.</li>
</ol>
<li>Download the Android SDK (includes Eclipse in the Package):</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Go to the following site: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">
Get the Android SDK</a>.</li>
<li>Click on "Download the SDK" (ADT Bundle for Windows).</li>
<li>Choose your platform and then "Download the SDK ADT Bundle for Windows".</li>
<li>Unzip your "adt-bundle-windows..." folder and place it somewhere OUTSIDE OF YOUR "Downloads" folder (wherever you want).</li>
</ol>
<li>Install Eclipse and the Android SDK:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Open your "adt-bundle-windows..." folder and then open your "eclipse" folder inside of that, and right-click on the first "Eclipse" icon you see (the purple icon) and rename it "Eclipse with Android", and if you see a ".exe" in the name, be careful to leave it there.  If you don't see the ".exe" before you rename it, don't worry about it.</li>
<li>Again, right-click on your "Eclipse with Android" icon and select either "Pin to Start Menu", "Pin to Taskbar" or "Create shortcut", depending on where you want to place your icon to start Eclipse.</li>
<ul>
<li>"Pin to Start Menu" will put it in your Start Menu.</li>
<li>"Pin to Taskbar" will put it on your Taskbar.</li>
<li>"Create shortcut" will create an "Eclipse with Android" shortcut icon that you can drag to your Desktop.</li>
</ul>
<li><i>Note: You can have more than one version of Eclipse running on your system at a time without a problem.  If you previously installed a different version of Eclipse, this will add a new one with its own workspace, and you can always choose which one to run.</i></li>
<li>Click on the new icon you have created to start Eclipse. You may be asked for permission to run it (give it permission) and then you will be asked to "Select a workspace" folder, but the default location is not an easy location to get to later.  I recomend that you either put it in your "Documents" folder (or "My Documents" for XP) or on your "Desktop".  To do this, just put the words "Documents\" or "Desktop\" (or "My Documents\" for XP) in front of the word "workspace" in the dialog shown.</li>
<li>The next screen will give you links to a set of Android Tutorials.  Our class will not work with Android Apps at first.  We will cover that material somewhat later.  So you can skip those tutorials and just clicking on the "X" on the "Android IDE" tab.</li>
<li>Now Eclipse is installed and ready to run Standard Java projects and Android projects.</li>
<li><i>Note: Initially in this class, you will only be creating standard Java projects.</i></li>
</ol>
